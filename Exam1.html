1. Explain about closures with example in javasript?
A.  Closuire is the combination of a function and bundled together with referenes to its surrounding states. it gives you access to an outer funtion scope to inner's function scope.
// nested function example

// outer function
funtion displayName() {
    console.log('Hi' + ' ' + name);
}
// calling inner function
display Name();
}
// calling outer function
greet('snad');


2. Explain about shallow copy and deep copy?
A. In shallow copy, a copy of the original object is stored and only the reference address is finally copied.
In deep copy, a copy of the original onject and repetitive copies both are stored


3. Explain about destructing of an object in javascript?
A. Destructuring, is the process of breaking a structure. In the context of programming, the structure are the data structures, and destructuring these data structures means unpacking individual values from the data structure. It can be applied to an object or Array.


4. What are the advantages of using arrow functions and give an example?
A. Benefits of arrow functions. one is shorter syntax and thus requires less code and another one is it removes the seveal pain points associated with the operator.
// function expression 
let x = fucntion(x,y) {
    return x*y;
}
// using arrow functions
let x = (x,y) => x*y;

let myFunction = (arg1, arg2, arg......N) => {
    statement(s)
}


5.Explain about higher order function in javascript?
A. Higher order functions are functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as argument or by returning them.

function.greeting() {
    console.log('Hello World');
}
// Invoking the function 
greeting();



6.Explain about event looping in javascript??
A. The event loop is a mechanism that allows javascript to perform non blocking  operations. When an asynchronous task is started, the event loop will start running. Once the task is completed, the event loop will again check for any other tasks that needs to be performed.



7. Explain about building blocks on an angular application?
A. The main building blocks for angular are modules, components, templates, metadata, data binding, directive, services, and dependency injection. Angular does not have a scope or controllers instead it uses a hirerachy components as it main architectural components.
Modules: modules are aimed for modularity and denoted by modularity means having the ability to disassemble the system, change parts, remove and add other parts easily.
Component: it is a piece of screen, visually and logically
Templates: the page display can be defined internally and a piece of code or externally
Metadata: It's just saying the information what to do with class.
Data binding: the complex part is to remember which name represents which direction and uses which symbol.
Directives: A directive in angular is a .js/.ts which is declared with directive.


8. What are the advantages of using Angular in web app development?
A. *It provides the capability to create a single page application in a very clean and maintainable way.
* it provides data binding capability to html 
*Angular js code is unit testable
*uses dependency injection and make use of separation of concerns.


9. What is single page application and explain about the advantages? 
A. Signle page applications are the most popular way to create websites that load faster without hitting the server every time the user interacts with the application.
*Quick loading time
*seamless user experience
*Ease in building feature rich apps.
*Uses less bandwidth





10. Explain about different data bindings in angular?
A. It is used to define the communication between a component and the dom. it is a technique to link your data to your view layer.
One way data binding: One way data binding is a simple one way communication where HTMl template is changed when we make changes in typescript code.
two way data binding: In two way data binding , automatic synchronization of data happens between the model and the view. chagnes is reflected in both the components.
